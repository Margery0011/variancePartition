## Introduction

This project is based on the paper called ["Functional human genes typically exhibit epigenetic conservation"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8439480/), where they have found that DepMap critical genes exhibit cell-specific preferential epigenetic conservation by comparing DNA methylation measurements across intestinal crypts from the same person as well as between duplicate cell lines.Therefore, they raised the hypothesis that essential genes are more conserved because if there is a deviation, it is not an important area of the genome since the body does not have to protect it.

## Things have done

- Recauculated the relationship between Colon epithelial average gene expression (log2 CPM) and variability (variance) with gene conservation (PWD)
- Redraw and optimize drawn figure for a better visualization of the relationship

## Things to do

- Download the transcription factor binding sites from [JASPAR database](https://jaspar.genereg.net/) to compare the regions we found interesting to examine if this hypothesis still stands in terms of transcriptome markers.
