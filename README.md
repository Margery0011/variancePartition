# Introduction

The Immune Variation (ImmVar) project assayed gene expression in CD14
+CD16 − monocytes and CD4 + T-cells on the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST
Array platform in order to characterize the role of cell type in genetic
regulation of gene expression. Here, I am going to use `variancePartition` to analyze data from this project. Details about [variancePartition](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1323-z#MOESM1)
