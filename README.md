# Introduction

The Immune Variation (ImmVar) project assayed gene expression in CD14
+CD16 âˆ’ monocytes and CD4 + T-cells on the Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST
Array platform in order to characterize the role of cell type in genetic
regulation of gene expression. Here, I am going to use `variancePartition` to analyze data from this project. Details about [variancePartition](chrome-extension://bocbaocobfecmglnmeaeppambideimao/pdf/viewer.html?file=https%3A%2F%2Fbioconductor.org%2Fpackages%2Frelease%2Fbioc%2Fvignettes%2FvariancePartition%2Finst%2Fdoc%2FvariancePartition.pdf)
